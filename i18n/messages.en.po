"<h2>Concept</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This trainer aims for you to get used to your keyboard. There is no "
"specific typing method, just you and your keyboard. So, it suits if you wish "
"to type with two fingers, and if you wish use ten fingers on each of three "
"hands, I suppose some users could be from Alpha Centauri, yeah :) It suits "
"for touch typing too.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To get used to any keyboard, it is necessary to press each key many "
"times. In the beginning, you consciously pay attention to this, then the "
"hands \"remember\" the key’s location on the keyboard and after that, they act "
"automatically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The trainer is flexible. It allows you to practice with any physical "
"keyboard, any language, any keyboard layout, and any typing principles.</p>"

"<h2>History of creation Idea</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the fall of 2020, my beloved wife gave me the new wonderful keyboard "
"<a href=\"https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Kinesis "
"Advantage 2</a> . And it immediately became quite clear that I can’t type on "
"it. I remembered how to type letters because I’ve mastered touch typing. All "
"other keys were out of their usual place. And my productivity was dropped to "
"almost zero. I felt like I use the keyboard for the first time in my life. "
"Since I have already known touch typing, I decided to update my skills on a "
"new keyboard by taking a suitable course. I found a trainer and even started "
"to press the letters, but then I realized that the trainer has no exercise "
"for service buttons. Then I looked for other trainers and tried many… the "
"same result. The Spacebar and Enter and the upper/lower case switch are "
"somehow taken into account by all these numerous courses, but many other "
"switches and extended characters are completely ignored. All the trainers I "
"found allow me to learn how to type letters, numbers, and a little "
"punctuation. This isn’t enough! And I decided to create the trainer that "
"trains my hands to use the entire keyboard. In fact, Enter, Control and Alt "
"buttons have no differences from the letter buttons. This is new concept…</p>"

"<h2>How it works</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The implementation of the simulator is based on the basic principles.</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\n"
"<li>All symbols / keys are grouped into Keyboard packs. Each \"Keyboard\" "
"containts a set of symbol or combinations. You can train every Keyboard "
"separately.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>There are also complex \"Kayboard\", for example \"English\" pack contains "
"all English letters, numbers and special keys, and punctuation.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>The \"Keyboard\" workout consists of lessons. Each lesson adds a subset of "
"symbols / keys. To study the lesson you make exercises. In the beginning "
"they contain only the symbols / keys of this lesson (up to a certain level). "
"Then all symbols from the lessons already passed are mixed in.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>The algorithm generates a random training text based on training "
"history. Symbols you made a mistake on are offered more frequently than "
"others. The algorithm tries to add characters/keys to the text so that you "
"type them all equally well.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>When all symbols and keys are learned, you start the last lesson of the "
"Keyboard pack. These exercises there contain all symbols and combinations.</"
"li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>When all the lessons are completed, you will be \"stuck\" in the last "
"lesson with texts consisting of all the keyboard characters until you type "
"each character a specified number of times. For each error, the number set "
"in the settings will be subtracted from the already dialed amount. The more "
"mistakes you make, the more the erroneous character / key will come across "
"in the generated texts. At the same time the trainer will switch to the "
"typing speed training mode. Algorithm will increase the metronome tempo "
"during exercises when you pass them without errors, and decrease the tempo "
"otherwise.</li>\n"
"</ul>"

"<h2>P.S. Plans</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are a lot of ideas here. I want to make some possibility to train "
"shortcuts. Not only usual when some modifiers pressed with some letter key, "
"but some like in Vim or Emacs, with some shortcuts sequence. Add possibility "
"to users to create their own custom keyboards. I afraid that there will be "
"some issues with European languages diacritics. And I have no idea if this "
"trailer could be useful for eastern languages like China or Japanese.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Also I noticed that it’s more fun to train not just with metronome tics, "
"but with some background music. For example disco gives rather smooth rhythm "
"of 100-130 bits per minute. And I have an idea to make some disco-mix with  "
"smooth rhythm change instead of simple metronome. Probably some synth music "
"will work also.</p>"

"<h2>Basic principles</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>To get used to the location of the key, you need to press it many times."
"</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>It is better to type slowly but without mistakes.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>You can increase the speed of the movement when your fingers are used to "
"button locations.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>When typing button combination it’s best to use both hands whenever "
"possible. For example, if you type a capital letter you press the "
"<kbd>Shift</kbd> with one hand and letter key with another.</li>\n"
